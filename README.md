# QIP-Tutorials
Conference series on quantum information processing
Quantum Information Processing (QIP) is a rapidly developing field of research spanning both physics and computer science. As the name implies, the field extends information processing (including computing and cryptography) to physical regimes where quantum effects become significant.

QIP is also the name of the largest annual conference in the field, attended by around three hundred researchers. This is the permanent website of the conference series, where you can find information about past and future editions of the conference.
